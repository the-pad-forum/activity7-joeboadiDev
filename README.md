# Quiz Web App

Welcome to the Quiz Web App project, an exciting exercise as part of the Full Stack Certificate Course by PAD FORUM. In this activity, we will be creating an interactive quiz application to further enhance our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to apply and reinforce what we've learned in the beginner phase while incorporating best practices in code development.

## Overview

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML:** Structure the content of our web app.
- **CSS:** Style the elements and make the app visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** Implement the quiz logic and interactivity.

### Hosting Platform:

The quiz app will be hosted using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), providing us with an easy and efficient way to share our project with others.

## Project Objectives:

1. **Create a Quiz Web App:** Develop a user-friendly application where users can engage with a set of quiz questions.

2. **Apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** Utilize our knowledge of front-end technologies to design an interactive and visually pleasing interface.

3. **Practice Best Coding Practices:** Embrace industry best practices in coding to enhance the quality and maintainability of our codebase.
